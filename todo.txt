Blockworld Project Todo:

1. Build node frame
    -node class

2(a). Implement depth first search

2(b). Implement breadth first search

3(c). Implement iterative deepening search

3(d). Implement some form of heuristic search

4. Run each search with various problem sizes and record results

5. Graph it

6. Write report
    -description of methods
    -evidence of search methods in operation
    -example solutions
    -describe how problem difficulty was controlled
    -plot of results
    -brief discussion
