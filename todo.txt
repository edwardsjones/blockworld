Blockworld Project Todo:

1. Build frame=DONE
    -implement board creator=DONE
    -some sort of state class (or equivalent)=DONE

2. Implement classes to make search possible=DONE
    -successor function--do on the fly?
        -actions=DONE
    -node class=DONE
    -solver class=DONE

2(a). Implement depth first search=DONE
    -add expand function=DONE
    -add some sort of basic ASCII problem viewer=DONE
    -implement pseudo code with stack=DONE
    -need to check if state is already visited=DONE
    -implement goal testing method=DONE
        *assuming that goal state only permits towers that start from the bottom
    -implement some sort of "solution" class=DONE
    -randomise moves=DONE

2(b). Implement breadth first search

3(c). Implement iterative deepening search

3(d). Implement some form of heuristic search

4. Run each search with various problem sizes and record results

5. Graph it

6. Write report
    -description of methods
    -evidence of search methods in operation
    -example solutions
    -describe how problem difficulty was controlled
    -plot of results
    -brief discussion

EXTRA:

1. Stop impossible puzzles being made.
